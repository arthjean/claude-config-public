## Fix Strategy Ranking

When multiple fix strategies exist, rank them using these three criteria in priority order:

### 1. Correctness (Highest Priority)

Does the fix address the root cause, not just suppress the symptom?

```
// BAD: suppresses the symptom
try {
  result = riskyOperation();
} catch (e) {
  result = null; // swallow error, masks the real problem
}

// GOOD: fixes the root cause
if (input !== undefined) {
  result = riskyOperation(input);
} else {
  return Err(MissingInputError);
}
```

Questions to verify correctness:
- Does this fix the error for ALL inputs, or just the one that triggered it?
- Would removing the fix cause the exact same error to return?
- Does this match how the API/library is supposed to be used (per docs)?

### 2. Safety (Second Priority)

Does the fix minimize side effects and avoid regressions?

**Blast radius assessment:**
- How many files does the fix touch?
- Does it change any public API signatures?
- Does it affect code paths other than the failing one?
- Could it break existing tests?

```
// BAD: high blast radius, changes shared utility
fn parse_config(path: &str) -> Config {
    // Changed return type, affects all 15 callers
}

// GOOD: low blast radius, fixes only the failing call site
fn handler() -> Result<(), AppError> {
    let config = parse_config("app.toml")
        .map_err(|e| AppError::Config(e))?;  // Add error handling at call site only
}
```

Safety rules:
- Prefer adding code over modifying existing code
- Prefer fixing the call site over fixing the callee (unless the callee is wrong)
- Never change function signatures unless the signature itself is the bug
- If the fix requires touching 5+ files, reconsider, there may be a simpler approach

### 3. Simplicity (Third Priority)

Is this the least invasive change that achieves correctness and safety?

```
// BAD: over-engineered fix
class RetryableErrorHandler {
  constructor(private maxRetries: number, private backoff: BackoffStrategy) {}
  async handle<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> { /* ... */ }
}

// GOOD: minimal fix for a one-off timeout
const result = await fetchWithTimeout(url, { timeout: 5000 });
```

Simplicity rules:
- One-line fixes are better than multi-line fixes
- Fixes in existing files are better than new files
- Fixes that use existing project patterns are better than introducing new ones
- Don't refactor while fixing, fix first, refactor later (if requested)

## Fix Patterns by Error Classification

### Compile Error Fixes

| Error Pattern | Fix Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|
| Missing import | Add the import, check if the module is in dependencies |
| Type mismatch in assignment | Fix the assignment OR fix the type annotation, determine which is wrong from context |
| Trait not implemented | Add derive macro or manual impl, check which traits the consuming code needs |
| Lifetime error | Usually fix the borrow structure, avoid `clone()` unless the data truly needs shared ownership |
| Unused variable warning | Remove the variable if dead code, prefix with `_` only if intentionally unused for now |

### Type Error Fixes

| Error Pattern | Fix Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|
| Null/undefined access | Add null check at the appropriate level, not at every level |
| Generic type mismatch | Add explicit type parameter at call site, or fix the generic constraint |
| Interface missing field | Add the missing field to the implementation, not make it optional in the interface |
| Type assertion needed | Prefer narrowing (type guards, `is`) over assertions (`as`, `!`) |

### Runtime Error Fixes

| Error Pattern | Fix Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|
| Unwrap on None | Use `?` operator (Rust), optional chaining (JS/TS), or explicit match |
| Index out of bounds | Add bounds check, or use `.get()` / `.get(index)` that returns Option/undefined |
| Null reference chain | Find which part of the chain is null and handle it, don't wrap entire chain in try/catch |
| Race condition | Add synchronization at the shared resource, not at every access point |

### Dependency Fixes

| Error Pattern | Fix Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|
| Version conflict | Pin both dependents to compatible versions, check what ranges overlap |
| Missing package | Add to manifest, verify the package name is correct (check registry) |
| Peer dependency | Install the required peer at the version specified in the warning |
| Lock file stale | Regenerate lock file from manifest, don't edit lock file manually |

### Config Fixes

| Error Pattern | Fix Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|
| Missing env var | Add to `.env.example` and document, set it in the current environment |
| Parse error | Fix the syntax, use a linter/validator for the config format |
| Wrong path | Use absolute path or resolve relative to project root, not CWD |
| Invalid value | Check documentation for valid range/type and correct the value |

### Logic Bug Fixes

| Error Pattern | Fix Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|
| Off-by-one | Fix the boundary condition, add a test for the boundary |
| Wrong comparison | Fix the operator, check if the spec says inclusive or exclusive |
| State mutation | Clone before mutation, or restructure to avoid shared mutation |
| Ordering bug | Make the dependency explicit, use await, then, or sequential composition |

## Fix Anti-Patterns

### The Shotgun Fix
Making changes in many places hoping one of them fixes it.

**Why it's bad:** Introduces unintended changes that may cause regressions later. Makes it impossible to understand what actually fixed the issue.

**Instead:** Identify the single root cause location and fix only there.

### The Suppression Fix
Catching/ignoring the error instead of fixing the cause.

```
// ANTI-PATTERN
try { dangerousOperation(); } catch { /* ignore */ }

// ANTI-PATTERN
result = value ?? defaultValue; // when value should never be null

// ANTI-PATTERN
@ts-ignore  // suppress type error without understanding it
```

**Why it's bad:** The underlying bug remains. It will resurface in a different form, usually harder to diagnose.

**Instead:** Understand why the error occurs and fix the condition that causes it.

### The Dependency Upgrade Fix
Upgrading a library hoping the bug is fixed in a newer version.

**Why it's bad:** May introduce new breaking changes. The bug might not be in the library. Version upgrades should be deliberate, not speculative.

**Instead:** Verify the bug is in the library (check GitHub issues), then upgrade to the specific version that contains the fix.

### The Copy-Paste Fix
Copying a solution from Stack Overflow or GitHub issues without understanding it.

**Why it's bad:** The solution may be for a different version, different context, or may have subtle bugs itself.

**Instead:** Understand WHY the solution works before applying it. Verify it matches your version and context.

### The Over-Engineering Fix
Adding abstraction layers, retry logic, or error handling infrastructure for a one-time issue.

**Why it's bad:** Adds permanent complexity for a temporary problem. The abstraction may never be used again.

**Instead:** Apply the minimal fix. If the issue recurs, then consider adding infrastructure.

### The Config Workaround
Disabling a check or safety feature to make the error go away.

```
// ANTI-PATTERN
// @ts-nocheck
// biome-ignore lint: <reason>
// #[allow(unused)]  when the variable IS used but in a way the linter can't see
// --no-verify
```

**Why it's bad:** The check exists for a reason. Disabling it masks the real issue and reduces safety for all future code.

**Instead:** Fix the code to satisfy the check. If the check is genuinely wrong, disable it narrowly with a comment explaining why.

## Verification Protocols

### After Compile Error Fix

```bash
# Rust (nothing is hook-enforced; run the linter yourself)
cargo clippy --no-deps   # lint: must be clean, denies panic!/unimplemented!/dbg!
cargo check          # fast type/borrow check
cargo build          # full build if check passes

# TypeScript
bunx tsc --noEmit    # type check only
bun run build        # full build

# Go
go build ./...       # build all packages
go vet ./...         # lint

# Python
python -m py_compile file.py  # syntax check
mypy file.py                  # type check (if configured)
```

### After Runtime Error Fix

```bash
# Run the specific failing test/command that produced the error
# Do NOT run the full test suite: focus on the failure

# Rust
cargo test test_name -- --exact

# TypeScript/JavaScript
bunx vitest run path/to/test.ts

# Python
pytest path/to/test.py::test_name -v

# Go
go test -run TestName ./package/...
```

### After Dependency Fix

```bash
# Verify lock file is consistent with manifest
cargo check              # Rust, regenerates Cargo.lock if needed
bun install              # Node, regenerates bun.lockb
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Python
go mod tidy              # Go, cleans up go.sum
```

### After Config Fix

Verify the application starts successfully:
```bash
# Dry-run or health check: don't run the full application
cargo run -- --help         # Rust CLI
bun run dev                 # Node dev server (check for startup errors)
python -c "from app import create_app; create_app()"  # Python
```

### After Logic Bug Fix

1. Run the failing test, it should now pass.
2. Check related tests, they should still pass.
3. If no test existed, suggest adding one for the boundary condition that was fixed.

## Fix Minimality Constraints

Research shows multi-agent debuggers make 40-60% more changes than necessary (Stanford DebugEVAL, 2025). Apply these constraints:

### Per-Line Justification

Every modified line must trace to the root cause:

```
// GOOD: each change is justified
- let x: u32 = "hello";  // root cause: type mismatch
+ let x: u32 = 42;       // fix: correct value type

// BAD: drive-by improvements
- let x: u32 = "hello";
+ let x: u32 = 42;       // fix
+ // Added proper type annotation  // unnecessary comment
```

### Change Scope Limits

For the canonical scope thresholds shared across skills, see `@~/.claude/skills/_shared/scope-guard.md`.

| Change scope | Action |
|---|---|
| 1-3 lines changed | Ideal, proceed |
| 4-10 lines changed | Acceptable, verify each line is justified |
| 11-20 lines changed | Warning, review for drive-by fixes, consider if a simpler approach exists |
| 20+ lines changed | STOP, this is likely over-fixing. Present the diagnosis and let the user decide scope |

### What NOT to Change

- Unrelated code near the fix location
- Import ordering or formatting
- Variable names that aren't part of the bug
- Comments on surrounding code
- Error handling for unrelated paths
- Type annotations on unrelated declarations

---

## DDI-Aware Fix Iteration

The Debugging Decay Index (DDI) describes exponential capability loss during repeated fix attempts (Scientific Reports, Dec 2025). The model is: E(t) = E₀ × e^(-λt), where λ ≈ 0.5-0.8 per attempt.

### Circuit Breaker Protocol

```
Attempt 1: Apply the top-ranked fix strategy
  → Verify (re-run reproduction command)
  → If PASS: done
  → If FAIL: record what was tried and WHY it failed

Attempt 2: Apply a DIFFERENT fix strategy (not a variation of Attempt 1)
  → Verify
  → If PASS: done
  → If FAIL: STOP, escalate to user

DO NOT attempt 3+. Present:
  - Root cause diagnosis
  - Two strategies attempted with failure reasons
  - Suggested next step requiring human judgment
```

### Strategy Differentiation

The second attempt MUST use a fundamentally different approach:

| Attempt 1 approach | Attempt 2 must NOT be | Attempt 2 should be |
|---|---|---|
| Fix the call site | Fix a different call site with slight variation | Fix the callee, or change the type/interface |
| Add a null check | Add a different null check | Restructure to avoid the null path entirely |
| Update the import | Try a different import path | Check if the dependency needs updating |
| Fix the type annotation | Tweak the same annotation | Change the underlying value or function signature |

## Regression Test Codification

Every fix represents a learning about the system's failure mode. Codify this learning as a test:

### When to Suggest a Regression Test

- The error was a logic bug, runtime error, or test failure
- A test file already exists for the affected module
- The fix involved a non-obvious boundary condition
- The bug could plausibly recur after future refactoring

### When NOT to Suggest

- The error was a syntax/compile error (compiler catches these)
- The error was a dependency/config issue (not testable in unit tests)
- The existing test suite already covers this case
- Adding the test would be trivial or redundant

### Regression Test Structure

```
// Test guards against: [one-sentence description of what was broken]
// Related fix: [file:line where the fix was applied]
test("should handle [specific condition that triggered the bug]", () => {
  // Arrange: set up the exact condition that caused the error
  // Act: execute the code path that was broken
  // Assert: verify the correct behavior (not just absence of error)
});
```

---

## When NOT to Fix

Sometimes the correct action is NOT to apply a fix:

1. **The error is in third-party code**: report the issue upstream, apply a local workaround, and document it.
2. **The error requires architectural changes**: explain the root cause and the architectural change needed. Let the user decide the scope.
3. **The error is environment-specific**: if the error only occurs in a specific environment (CI, production) that you can't reproduce, explain the likely cause and suggest verification steps for that environment.
4. **The fix would break other things**: if the blast radius is high and you're not confident in all the implications, present the diagnosis and let the user choose the fix approach.
5. **The "error" is intentional**: some warnings or errors are expected (e.g., deprecation warnings during a planned migration). Confirm with the user before "fixing" something that may be intentional.
6. **Confidence is LOW and 2 attempts failed**: escalate to the user with diagnosis and evidence rather than continuing to iterate.
