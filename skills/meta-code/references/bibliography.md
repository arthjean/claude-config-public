# Bibliography: Multi-Agent Research Pipeline

**Design-time reference only**: not loaded during pipeline execution. These sources document the research basis for pipeline design decisions. For the pipeline itself, see [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

Curated sources informing the meta-code pipeline design. Organized by tier: T1 sources are directly implemented in the pipeline, T2 sources provide supporting patterns.

## T1: Directly Implemented

Sources whose specific patterns, formulas, or protocols are directly encoded in the pipeline.

### Orchestration Architecture

- [Building Effective Agents, Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents): Six composable patterns: prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, orchestrator-workers, evaluator-optimizer. Anti-pattern: framework over-reliance obscuring underlying logic.
