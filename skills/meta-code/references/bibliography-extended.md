## Orchestration Patterns

- [Agent Orchestration, OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/multi_agent/): Agents-as-tools vs handoffs; code-driven > LLM-driven for predictable pipelines. Hybrid recommendation: code-driven routing + LLM-driven reasoning.
- [8 Named Patterns, Google Developers Blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/developers-guide-to-multi-agent-patterns-in-adk/): Sequential, Coordinator, Parallel Fan-Out, Generator-Critic, Iterative Refinement, Composite.
- [12 Architecture Patterns, Google Cloud Architecture Center](https://docs.google.com/architecture/choose-design-pattern-agentic-ai-system): Extends ADK 8 patterns with Swarm, ReAct, Human-in-the-Loop, Custom Logic. Diamond pattern (post-generation moderation) and Peer-to-peer handoff.
- [Multi-Agent Systems, Google ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/multi-agents/): `escalate=True` for quality-gated loop termination; deterministic workflow primitives.
- [Practical Guide to Building Agents, OpenAI](https://openai.com/business/guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-ai-agents/): Start single-agent; 3-layer guardrails (input filtering, tool-use validation, human-in-the-loop).
- [Cursor 2.0 Changelog](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-0): Git worktrees as isolation primitive; plan with one model, execute with another.
- [AdaptOrch, arXiv:2602.16873](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16873): Topology-aware orchestration +12-23% over static baselines. Informs early-exit conditions.
- [Boris Cherny, Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/head-of-claude-code-what-happens): Clean codebases boost AI productivity; complete migrations fully.
<!-- Google/MIT Scaling, OpenAI Deep Research, Codex Subagents, Cursor Agent Best Practices: see bibliography.md T1 -->
- [Cursor Automations March 2026](https://releasebot.io/updates/cursor): Event-driven background agents with memory across runs; invariant validation subagents; parallel agent judging.

## Quality & Evaluation

- [Demystifying Evals for AI Agents, Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents): Code-based > model-based graders; pass@k vs pass^k; grade outcomes not paths.
- [Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents, Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents): Progress files, git checkpoints, JSON > Markdown for state.
- [VMAO, arXiv:2603.11445](https://arxiv.org/html/2603.11445v1): ResultVerifier with 0-1 completeness scoring, gap identification.
- [Ragas Available Metrics](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/): Noise Sensitivity, Context Entities Recall, Tool Call Accuracy metrics.
- [ADK Evaluation, Google](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/): Tool trajectory matching (EXACT, IN_ORDER, ANY_ORDER), LLM-as-judge, User Simulation evaluation.
- [Evaluation Best Practices, OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evaluation-best-practices): Trajectory-based > final-output-only; o3 as recommended grader; chain-of-thought before scoring.

## Confidence & Calibration

- [Confidence Calibration via Multi-Agent Deliberation, arXiv:2404.09127](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09127): Post-hoc calibration via simulated group deliberation.
- [OI-MAS: Confidence-Aware Routing, arXiv:2601.04861](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.04861v1): State-dependent routing by agent confidence at each reasoning step.

## Advanced Decomposition

- [HopRAG, arXiv:2502.12442](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12442): Retrieve-reason-prune for multi-hop expansion.
- [Exploration-Exploitation Query Decomposition, arXiv:2510.18633](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18633): Bandit-framed retrieval; +35% document-level precision.

## Multi-Agent Debate Failure Modes

- [Talk Isn't Always Cheap, arXiv:2509.05396](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.05396v1): Group accuracy declines over successive debate rounds; sycophancy causes strong models to yield.
- [Deliberative Dynamics, arXiv:2510.10002](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10002v2): Sycophancy is format-dependent; interaction format shapes behavior beyond prompt context.

## Skills & Output

- [Claude Code Skills, Official Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills): SKILL.md spec, frontmatter fields, progressive disclosure.
- [Agent Skills Open Standard, Anthropic](https://claude.com/blog/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills): 3-layer progressive disclosure architecture. Adopted by GitHub Copilot, Cursor, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI.
